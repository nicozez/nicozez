- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicozez!
- 👀 I’m interested in how the creative arts and technology intersect. I also really like musical performance and ChucK.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying electrical engineering & music @ Stanford. Specifically, with an intent to focus on signal processing, musical hardware, and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with the intersection of biology, economics / psychology, or music with tech.
- 📫 nicozez@stanford.edu.
