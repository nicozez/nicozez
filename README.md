- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicozez!
- 👀 I’m interested in biotechnology, mechatronics, and behavioural sciences. I also really like music and production.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mechanical engineering / computer science @ Stanford. Specifically, product realization, systems engineering, and music technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with the intersection of animal physiology, music, neuroscience, with tech.
- 📫 nicozez@stanford.edu.
