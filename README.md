- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicozez!
- 👀 I’m interested in biotechnology, mechatronics, and behavioural sciences. I also really like music production.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying mechanical engineering / computer science @ Stanford. Specifically, with an intent to focus on product realization in mechanical engineering and quantitative finance using CS. I also plan to minor in music technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with the intersection of biology, economics, and psychology with tech.
- 📫 nicozez@stanford.edu.
